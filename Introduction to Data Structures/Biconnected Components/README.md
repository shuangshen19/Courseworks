# Biconnected Components

## Descriptions:
Given the relationship between a point and a point, I hope to find the articulation point from the connected graph and find out their biconnected components relationship

A tomato country has 10 cities and there is at least one between any two cities. Road can be reached. Due to the countryâ€™s financial difficulties, select some of these cities to set up toll stations (the red dots in the figure below), and these selected city must meet the following two points: 
* At least two other than the selected city
* The city and the path of these two cities must pass through the selected city. Hope classmate
  
Find the relationship (biconnected components)

## Program environment:
Implement on C++ (Codeblocks 16.01)
