2018/10/30

## User Requirements:
* Students must apply before they can use this system to upload their application materials, and provide the name, title, and e-mail address of each recommendation letter writer. 
* The writer also needs to apply for a platform account for the system to record the information. The recommendation letter writer should be within the predetermined deadline.
* The student who has completed the recommendation letter uploading will be able to check whether the recommendation letter within the project he is applying for has been uploaded, but cannot check the content of the letter. 
* The system will record the applicant and recommender’s information on this platform for the institution to verify integrity

## System Requirements:
* 1.1 The student will get an account dedicated to him for uploading his autobiography, reading plan and other materials
* 1.2 When making an application, students will follow the application of each school department and group or other organization to obtain each different application to fill in the link, and the system will link the link to the student’s letter of recommendation writer’s mailbox
* 2.1 The system will attach the final date of the recommendation letter of this school or institution to the letter so that the writer can complete it within the deadline
* 2.2 Two days before the deadline, the writers of the unfinished recommendation letter and their applicants will be notified again to protect the rights of both parties
* 3.1 Applicants will be able to log in to the system at any time to check that their recommendation letter writer has not or has completed the upload of the recommendation letter and related matters
* 3.2 Applicants will only be able to judge whether the recommendation letter is uploaded or not. The content of the recommendation letter will be encrypted by the system and can be viewed by the school or institution that can apply for it.
* 4.1 The system will preliminarily check whether the content of the applicant's information is roughly consistent with the content written by the recommender, and give a primary integrity score for the institution's reference
* 4.2 The agency will give another integrity score after the review, and record it to the account of the applicant and the recommender after averaging for the agency to check its total integrity score for the next recommendation
