# HW: Maintainability 

2018/10/23

## What is maintainability? 

In few words, maintainability means the code is easy to change, update, improve, and understand.
Maintainability is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to:

* Fix a bug without introducing a new bug
* Repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts
* Prevent unexpected working condition
* Maximize a product's useful life
* Increase performance; maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety
* Meet new requirements
* Make future maintenance easier
* Make a fix that prevents a bug from occurring in future
* Cope with a changed environment

Maintainable softwares can be expanded to satisfy new or changing requirements, which may include enhancing existing functions, modifying for hardware upgrades, and correcting code errors. The means of achieving this goal depends on a combination of many tools and techniques:

* Early planning: anticipating what and how programs might be modified at a later stage.
* Modular design: defining subsets and simplifying functionality (i.e., one module performs only one function).
* Object-oriented design: encapsulating both methods and data structures to achieve a higher level of independence than that of modular design.
* Uniform conventions: facilitating error detection and debugging.
* Naming conventions: providing understandable codes.
* Coding standards, comments, and style: enhancing readability of the program.
* Documentation standards.
* Common toolsets.
* Configuration Management

The maintainability of software depends on several different factors. In some cases, maintainability involves a continuous improvement system (learning from the past to improve the ability to maintain the system, or to improve the reliability of the system based on maintenance experience) The maintainability of the software must be easy to understand the software (how to work, what to do, why to do it), easy to find what needs to be changed, easy to make changes and not cause other errors.

The program may be modified over time, and may be changed by the team or other people. Therefore, by following the principle of maintainability, writing should be well-designed and structured using standard software engineering principles and frameworks.

## Why is maintainability desirable?

I am familiar with this software today, but will my mind change in the next week or six months from now? If the developer of this software leaves the team, how can new developers speed up their familiarity with the software? What if the project must be suspended if necessary until it restarts after a year?

Under these circumstances, the inability to easily understand the software will cause developers to waste their precious time. If this time can be saved and used to improve the software, it will create greater benefits. Therefore, maintainable software is easy to understand software. That is to say, this is a way for new developers to use faster time to familiarize themselves with the code when they are familiar with the software.

## Waht is recommendation system?
The recommendation system is mainly based on content, user's basic information (Content) or user's record, behavior (Behavior) to make recommendations; that is, content-based content filtering (Content Filtering), and collaborative filtering (Collaborative Filtering). If a person A has the same opinions as a person B on a certain issue, then on another matter, A is more likely to agree with B than a random person. If you put in the information of professors and students, enter the classes the students have taken, the activities they have participated in, etc., and match them, you can roughly understand which professor the student wants to study is related to, and it will be more convincing and take credit accumulation similar to that of banks to assess credit.
