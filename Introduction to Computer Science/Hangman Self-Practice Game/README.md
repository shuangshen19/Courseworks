# Hangman Self-Practice Game

## Description of Requirement:
HangMan is a small game that can test the ability of self-reciting English. Users may expect to learn English when using it. This game can accurately test this ability. After my program has solved the problem, an explanation of that word will appear, which I think is particularly attractive to users. Because this allows users not only to improve their ability to recite but also to allow users to better understand the meaning of this word.

## Requirements implementation:
In the beginning, I used the do-while function so that the user can keep typing the difficulty until the format is correct. In the content part, I use graphical hanging ghosts to make the screen more interesting, and a large number of if conditions and for loops to determine whether the user's input is right or wrong, and give corresponding answers. In the end, use the if function to judge whether to continue or make 15 mistakes and end the game after passing through successfully.

## Program flow:


## User manual:
* run_cmdðŸ¡ªcompile enter javac hw2.javaðŸ¡ª enter java hw2 to execute the game
* After completing the above input, the initial screen and rules of the game will appear
* After selecting the difficulty (BABY, EASY, NORMAL, HARD, HELL), enter the corresponding level
* There are 3 levels in a difficulty, and the game ends after all 3 levels are passed or after 15 errors
* You can use the prompt function before 13 errors #Help_Me

## Others: 
My program is roughly divided into 3 parts, the first is the initial screen selection difficulty, the second is the user starts to play the game, and the last is the corresponding result; the user only needs to choose the difficulty at the beginning, and then guess the letter, You can also use the prompt function if you canâ€™t guess, and finally you can check your own recitation ability.
