# Life TV Simulator

## Description of Requirement:
This is a program that allows users to simulate the situation of watching TV. If the user does not have a TV to watch at home, the user can experience the fun of watching TV; if the user has a TV at home, the user can also experience the basics The fun of watching TV in general. My program will show a corresponding prompt when the user makes a mistake, so that the user can understand where he is wrong. Adding beauty editing to the commands above and below, so that when watching analog TV, you won't be dazzled by too much text, and it can also make users feel happier.

## Object design:
I used 4 objects, namely channel, program, volume, and time. When writing the object, I first specify the screen that the user will run when executing; in the channel and program, I wrote the settings, got the name and The various numbers make it more convenient for me to use the main program. In Channel, I wrote the function that can switch the channel, and in Volume, I wrote the function that can increase and decrease the volume, and it can be printed in In the time, I wrote a function that can print out the time entered by the user. These programs can interact with the main program when the main program defines objects, run out of the screen, and interact with the main program in their respective fields.

## Procedure flow chart:
I designed the loop and input debugging and the function of judging the text input by the user:
User input
Follow user input to determine different responses
As shown below


## Instructions for use:
* run_cmdðŸ¡ªCompile and enter javachw3.javaðŸ¡ªEnter java hw3 to execute the program
* After completing the above input, the initial screen of the analog TV will appear
* Enter the corresponding command to operate
* Enter to exit the program

## Others: 
My program is roughly divided into 3 parts, the first is the initial screen, the second is the execution of the interaction between the analog TV and each object, and the last is the corresponding result; the user only needs to enter the corresponding command.
