# Recursive Method

## Descriptions:
Use the recursive method to write programs to calculate mathematical combination problems, and further explore program design. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of the concept and implementation.

* Recursive Method: Find out a set of rules to narrow the scope of the problem, so as to keep narrowing the problem until the details can be clarified, and then the answer can be summarized. Programs generally use function push calls.
* Simply put, the recursive method is to call the function repeatedly to get the answer.

## Question:
There are numbers 1~n, and k numbers are selected from these n numbers. How many options are there?
* Please write the program in a recursive manner to print out all the options.
* Example: n=5, k=3, select three numbers from five numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

### Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the recursive method:
Advantages:
* Simplify code and shorten programming time
* Simplify more complex problems
* Easier to read
  
Disadvantages:
* It takes more time to think
* Hard to escape from the original thinking
* Execution is slower than without using the recursive method

## Program environment:
Implement on C (Dev C++, GCC 4.9.2)
